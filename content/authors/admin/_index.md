#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I’m Mauricio Soto, a passionate Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience building modern web and mobile applications.

I specialize in React, React Native, and TypeScript, but I also have strong full-stack expertise with Node.js, Python, Django, and PostgreSQL. Over the years, I’ve contributed to high-impact projects for both Brazilian and international companies, delivering scalable solutions and improving user experiences across different platforms.

Beyond my technical skills, I’m naturally curious and enjoy studying everything related to backend, DevOps, and software architecture. I value clean code, best practices, and collaborative teamwork.
I’m fluent in Portuguese, Spanish, and English, which has allowed me to work seamlessly with teams across Brazil, the U.S., and beyond.
When I’m not coding, I’m often exploring new technologies, refining my craft, and continuously learning—because I believe great software comes from both passion and discipline.
